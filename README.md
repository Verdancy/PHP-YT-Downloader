# php-yt-downloader

This project was inspired by a very popular youtube-dl python package:  
https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl

Yes, there are multiple other PHP-based youtube downloaders on the Internet, 
but most of them haven't been updated in years, or they depend on youtube-dl itself.  

Pure PHP-based youtube downloaders that work, and are **kept-up-to date** just do not exist.

This script uses no Javascript interpreters, no calls to shell... nothing but pure PHP with no heavy dependencies either.

That's all there is to it!
